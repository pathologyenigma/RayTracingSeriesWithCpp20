# Ray tracing Series with cpp20
## Motivation
***I just recently back to cpp coding***
***And I just always like some thing new***
***Mostly because of module's high performance.***
## Why visual studio
***First, my coding habits is growing up with visual studio;***
***And I found MSVC is the only compiler that has the whole support of module when I decided to write this***
***The most important thing is that I living in the place that needs maybe a thousand years to download the llvm and clang, and will got 404 when trying to download mingw***
## Cross-platform things
***I really want it to be cross-platform but I haven using CMake for a while, maybe I'll try it in the future(when I have time)***
***PS: build2 seems good, and get official tutorial of the module. maybe I will using this one?***

*this is not a tutorial of ray tracing*
*I just rewrote the code in cpp20 with module and some other staff*
